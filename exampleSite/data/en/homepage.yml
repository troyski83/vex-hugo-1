  title: Created By A Loving But Frustrated Dog Owner
  content: Denali the husky is one of the family…. but… he likes to chew. After destroying
    his first three dog beds by chewing and digging through them, we set off on a
    mission to make a chew proof dog bed. First we tried to wrap the edges of a traditional
    dog bed bed with aluminium but Denali found a weakness at the edges. On our second
    attempt we protected the edges of the canvas from chewing but he ended up digging
    through the bed. After a few more attempts we won the battle and decided to manufacture
    the Denali Dog Bed. We hope you can enjoy the end product and spend less time
    worrying about your dogs bed and more time enjoying your dogs company!

    content: I foster several dogs every year until they find a new forever home.
      I used to go through several beds a year until I started using the Denali Dog
      Bed. Now I have 3 Denali Dog Beds that have lasted over 12 months and are still
      going strong. The dogs love the beds!

    content: My puppy loves to eat his bed. I tried everything and anything to stop
      him with sprays and deterrents. Thank goodness I've found the Denali Dog Bed!

    content: I need to keep my Groodles in prime condition and ensure they rest off
      the ground to save their joints. I love the Denali Dog Beds. They are much better
      than the standard hammock design and for not much extra cost!
