  title: Created By A Loving But Frustrated Dog Owner
  content: Denali is one of the family…. but… he likes to chew. After destroying his
    first three dog beds by chewing and digging through them, we set off on a mission
    to make a chew proof dog bed. We firstly tried to wrap the edges of a traditional
    dog bed bed with aluminium. On our second attempt we needed to protect the edge
    of the canvas from chewing but he ended up digging through the bed [see image
    on the left]. After a few more attempts, we were able to manufacture the Denali
    Dog Bed. We hope you can enjoy the end product and spend less time worrying about
    your dogs bed and more time enjoying your dogs company!

    content: A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
      feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
      souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
      sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
